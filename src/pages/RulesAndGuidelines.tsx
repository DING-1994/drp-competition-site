      <Heading>Challenge Description</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        Welcome to the AAMAS 2024 Drone Delivery Routing Problems Competition.
        These are the Rules and Guidelines of this competition.This is organized
        by Shiyao Ding,Hideki Aoyama,Donghui Lin and Fumito Uwano. Github and
        this website provies any information about this competition.Please read
        these rules carefully.If you don't agree with (or cannot comply with)
        the rules, then you may not participate in this Challenge.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        This competition aims to advance multi-agent reinforcement learning
        across various disciplines such as logistics, computer science, and
        operations research. This challenge addresses a real-world issue
        encountered by transportation and logistics companies globally.
        Participants are tasked with finding routes that minimize the number of
        steps for each agent to reach its destination without colliding with
        others.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In this competition, we have designed an environment that simulates
        real-world drone delivery conditions, and participants navigate this
        environment to complete the task. The environment is a simple grid space
        consisting of nodes and edges, with distances assigned to the edges.
        Agents move across the map based on specific policies and are
        constrained to exist only on nodes and edges. Each agent has unique
        nodes as their destination and departure points. The agent can ascertain
        the positions of other agents only when they appear on an adjacent node.
        Furthermore, once an agent enters an edge, it maintains its direction
        until it reaches a node.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Agents are allowed to move until they either collide with each other or
        until all agents reach their respective goals. In this dynamic
        environment, participants approach problem-solving through an
        interdisciplinary methodology.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading>Code fairness</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        In terms of code fairness, sharing information among teams is strictly
        restricted. It is forbidden to use the code of other teams and vice
        versa. To prevent code plagiarism, participants are prohibited from
        engaging in direct code exchanges with each other. As time progresses,
        there is an increasing need to optimize transportation. To tackle this
        issue, let's initially address it within a virtual environment. We hope
        that such initiatives contribute not only to addressing specific
        transportation methods but also to the overall transportation problem.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading>Q&A</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        To support participants and ensure the success of this competition, we
        plan to accept questions from participants. A webpage and a GitHub
        repository will be set up to handle participant questions. The content
        of the Q&A session will be made publicly available on the webpage to
        ensure all participants have access to the information unless the
        question is related to personal information.Additionally, there are
        plans to include instructions on how to use the environment and provide
        a basic guide on using Stable Baselines.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading>Registration and Participation</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        To participate in this competition, the team must complete the following
        form from the "participate" button on the top.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        You can participate in this Challenge alone or as a team. These is no
        maximum team member, and the minimum team size is one person.
        Participants may not collaborate unless those participants entered this
        Challenge as a team; participants who are members of the same team may
        collaborate with one another. Teams may not be merged.

      <Heading>The Competition Evaluation Criteria</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        In this competition, we set three maps with different scalability and
        shapes. As for each map, we set a 10 patterns with different starts and
        goals. Therefore, the above three maps with ten patterns would result in
        30 result data which are used to calculate the average values for{" "}
        <em>goal rate</em> and <em>moving time</em>. The evaluation will firstly
        be based on the goal rate of all agents. If they reach a same goal rate,
        the moving time would be the indicator to rank. We set two phases of
        submission where the pre-submission phase is used to test the which are
        not relevant to the final evaluation. The scores submitted during the
        final submission phase will be considered for the final evaluation.
        During the final submission phase, participants can submit their
        programs with many times, the highest score from the submission will be
        used for the final evaluation.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading>Finalist</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        Each submission undergoes scoring and ranking based on the evaluation
        metrics specified on the website. The top three teams are then selected
        as finalists. During the finalist determination process, we thoroughly
        examine each submission to ensure it meets the following criteria:
      </Paragraph>
      <Ul>
        <li>
          Code fairness: Confirming there is no plagiarism from other teams in
          the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          model reproducibility: Verifying that the score is independent of the
          state of the environment.
        </li>
      </Ul>
      <Paragraph>
        If a team fails to meet these criteria, the participant cannot be
        selected as a finalist, regardless of their score. The announcement of
        finalists for this competition is made on the website. Certificates will
        be provided to all participants whose programs run successfully.
        Furthermore, we will select three teams as finalists based on their
        ability to achieve a higher average goal rate among five maps. In the
        event of a tie in the goal rate, the moving time will serve as the
        ranking indicator. We will provide certificates to all participants
        whose programs run successfully.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading>Others</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        â€‹While participants are allowed to modify the functions within the
        environment, they are not permitted to alter the fundamental behavior of
        the agents. For example, changing the definition of collisions or
        expanding the range of agent movement beyond nodes and edges would not
        be allowed.
