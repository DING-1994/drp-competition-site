        Each submission undergoes scoring and ranking based on the evaluation
        metrics specified on the homepage. The top three teams are then selected
        as finalists. During the finalist determination process, we thoroughly
        examine each submission to ensure it meets the following criteria:
      </Paragraph>
      <Ul>
        <li>
          Code fairness: Confirming there is no plagiarism from other teams in
          the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Model reproducibility: Verifying that the score is independent of the
          state of the environment.
        </li>
      </Ul>
      <Paragraph>
        Sharing information among teams is strictly restricted. It is forbidden
        to use the code of other teams and vice versa.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        If a team fails to meet these criteria, the participant cannot be
        selected as a finalist, regardless of their score. The announcement of
        finalists for this competition is made on the homepage. We will select
        three teams as finalists based on their score.

        Participants are permitted to add functions within the environment;
        however, they are not allowed to alter the fundamental behavior of the
        agents and the environment. For instance, modifying the definition of
        collisions or extending the range of agent movement beyond nodes and
        edges is strictly prohibited.
